            <p class= 'about_narrative'>Because of my passion for technology and coding, I changed my career to become a Web Designer/Developer. I have a background in DB2/SQL programming and teaching. I successfully completed an intensive 12 week full immersion Web Development boot camp which is equivalent to 12 months and more than 750 hours of training. </p>

            <p class= 'about_narrative'>The program was done in a project-oriented environment in which we focused on coding around specific technologies and frameworks/libraries, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and AJAX on the client side. We worked with PHP/MySQL, Amazon AWS, and basic Apache on the server side.</p>
            <p> I extensively utilized Github for version control in an agile development environment. I built, modified, and maintained numerous scalable applications/websites from inception to completion. </p>
            
            <p class= 'about_narrative'>I am currently combining my two passions: Education and Web design/development together in creating a website where students of all ages can go -- to improve/practice their reading skills by reading stories that contain repetitive phonics, comprehension questions, and games. </p>

           <p class= 'about_narrative'> I thrive on constantly learning new skills and am passionate about using my new knowledge in developing new applications.</p>
