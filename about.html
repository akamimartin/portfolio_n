            <h3>Hi, a little about me...</h3>
            <p>As a trail blazer, I have ventured into areas where no woman has gone before..... Entering High School, I thought it was perfectly normal for a female to be on the cross-country team.</p>

            <p>But lo and behold, I was a bit befuddled at the reception I got when I told my counselor that I planned to run on the cross-country team. First, her eyes looked a bit puzzled and then I could see her mind in utter turmoil -- as if she was strugging to find the right words to tell me. And then they came out in a burst.."You can't run, they don't have a girls' cross-country team."</p>

            <p>Well, I thought for a mere two seconds and replied, "no problem, I'll run with the boys' team." Which she replied even more distressesd. "You can't run on the boys' team, you're a girl." Well, to make a long story short, I and two other girls did compete that year on the boys' cross-country team.</p>
