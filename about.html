            <p class= 'about_narrative'>With my passion for technology, I changed my career to become a Web Designer/Developer. I have a background in DB2/SQL programming and teaching. I just recently successfully completed an intensive 12 week full immersion Web Development boot camp which represented 12 months and greater than 750 hours of training. The program was done in a project-oriented environment in which it focused on coding around specific technologies, as well as frameworks/libraries including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/jQuery, and AJAX on the client side along with PHP/MySQL,  Amazon AWS and basic Apache on the server side.  I extensively utilized Github for version control in a development environment. I built, modified and maintained numerous scalable applications/websites from inception to completion.  I am currently creating a website where students of all ages can go to improve/practice their reading skills by reading stories that contain repetitive phonics and comprehension questions. </p>


   







           <p class= 'about_narrative'> I thrive on constantly learning new skills and am passionate about using my new knowledge in developing new applications.</p>
